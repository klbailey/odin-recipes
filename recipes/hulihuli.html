<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Huli Huli Chicken (turn, turn) has been a Hawaiian staple with sticky rice for quite some time.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 3-pound chickens, each cut into 8 pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup unsweetened pineapple juice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sherry</li>
    <li>1 2-inch piece of fresh ginger, crushed</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>    
    <li>Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Combine pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, sherry, ginger, garlic, green onions,
        and dry mustard in a large resealable plastic bag, stirring the marinade until brown sugar has dissolved.
    </li>
    <li>Place chicken pieces into the bag, squeeze out air, seal bag, and lomi (massage) bag to coat chicken with
        marinade; refrigerate at least 4  hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Move an oven rack 6 inches from heat source and preheat oven to 425 degrees F or 220 degrees C.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from marinade and arrange chicken, skin sides up, on a broiler pan.</li>
    <li>Bake chicken in preheated oven until browned on both sides and the juices run clear, turning every ten
        minutes, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Baste with remaining marinade after each turning.  An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest
        piece of chicken, not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F or 70 degrees C.</li>
</ol>
